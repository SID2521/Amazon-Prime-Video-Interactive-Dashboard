# Amazon-Prime-Video-Interactive-Dashboard
In my project showcasing Amazon Prime Videos, I present an interactive dashboard displaying a comprehensive overview of movies and shows available on the platform. Through meticulous data analysis, I provide detailed information such as genre distribution, user ratings, release dates, and viewer demographics. By offering this interactive dashboard, I aim to provide users with valuable insights into the content available on Amazon Prime Videos, enabling them to make informed decisions about their viewing preferences and enhancing their overall streaming experience.
